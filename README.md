# Alex Lee — Personal Portfolio Website

This is the source repository for my personal website, showcasing my portfolio, background, and blog. Built with React and SASS, this site demonstrates modern front-end architecture, component-driven design, and custom styling.

##  Tech Stack

- **React** — Core library powering the front-end UI
- **SASS (SCSS flavor)** — Advanced styling with modular structure, variables, mixins, and nesting
- **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)** — Leverages features like arrow functions, modules, destructuring, template literals, and async/await
- **React Router** — Handles smooth client-side routing (if applicable)
- **CSS Modules / BEM / Scoped Styles** — Organization and modularization of styles (adapt as needed)
- **Webpack / Create React App / Vite** — Bundling, transpilation (Babel), hot-reload, and production optimization (tailor to your actual setup)
